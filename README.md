# Emergency-Vehicle-Dispatch-System

The "Emergency Vehicle Dispatching System" is designed to track and manage the availability of emergency vehicles—ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars—across various zip codes. Each zip code initially holds three of each vehicle type. The system processes requests for emergency vehicles, checking their availability at the requested zip code. If resources are not available, it searches for the nearest zip code with available resources using Dijkstra's algorithm
